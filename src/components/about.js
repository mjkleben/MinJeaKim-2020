                <p>Raised by a pen and brush, surrounded by musical notes since birth, and born to eat donuts. </p>
                <p>When you don’t catch me coding or designing, you’ll probably see my playing an instrument, weightlifting, or learning a foreign language. I take it upon myself to keep up with current tech and to always improve myself, as my motto is “Love to learn, learn to love.”</p>
